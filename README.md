# Markov Chain Monte Carlo Program[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url] [![Coverage percentage][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]

## Using the program

1) Click on the screen where you want to localize the node 0 (main node). This node will be colored in red to distinguish it from others nodes.
2) Continue adding nodes by clicking on the screen.
3) Set up the "temperature" and the number of steps that you want to employ to obtain a reasonable structure.
4) Press "RUN" to see how the method proceeds to propose a new structure.


## Initial graph

The initial condition for the graph is a complete connected graph, where each node is connected to every other possible node.



The way that a node an
Node require 2 values (x,y) which is the position on a 2D space.
Nodes has to be inside the graph BEFORE adding an Edge.
To add an edge you have to specify 2 nodes.
```js
    let g = new Graph();
    let A = new Node(0, 1);
    let B = new Node(1, 1);
    let C = new Node(1, 0);
    let D = new Node(3, 1);
    g.addNode(A);
    g.addNode(B);
    g.addNode(C);
    g.addNode(D);

    g.addEdge(A, B);
    g.addEdge(B, C);
    g.addEdge(B, D);
```

 Example of how to get the Weight of the graph once the nodes and edges has been inserted.

 let weight = thetaFunction(g, A);  
 
 Where A is the Central Node.
